aw-fakedata
===========

A minimal ActivityWatch client that generates fake data, for use in testing and such.

It only works with ActivityWatch running in testing mode and generates into a fake host with the name fake-data to not overwrite your other clients in testing mode.

By default generates events for 8 hours.
